# A Simple Game of Rock, Paper, Scissors

I randomly made this as part of [The Odin Project][1], a free coding curriculum that actually taught me how to code. I enhanced the game a bit to include the "overall" game score with a click counter at the bottom -- just to track how many clicks you made!

Enjoy it during your free time.

I'm also on [TikTok][2] | [Youtube][3] | and [IG][4], where you'll find different content for the different platforms.
