# A Simple Game of Rock, Paper, Scissors

Play the game here. Make here you take your time at first so it can make sense (haha!): https://itsvictoroyedeji.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/

I randomly made this as part of [The Odin Project][1], a free coding curriculum that actually taught me how to code. 

I enhanced the game a bit to include the "overall" game score with a click counter at the bottom -- just to track how many clicks you made!

Enjoy it during your free time.
