# A Simple Game of Rock, Paper, Scissors

I randomly made this as part of [The Odin Project][1]. I enhanced the game a bit to include the "overall" match store, and an click counter at the bottom -- just to track how click clicks you have!

Enjoy it at your free time.

I'm also on [TikTok][2] | [Youtube][3] | and [IG][4], where you find different content for the different platforms.
